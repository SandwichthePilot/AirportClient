Before using:
open a cmd or terminal window
and type:
(pip install pyttsx3)
I suggest using VSC and using the "Python" extension by Microsoft but anything that runs python will work so long as you understand how to use it
For VSC:

1) file > New File > Python File
2) Go to the (https://github.com/SandwichthePilot/AirportClient/blob/main/AirportClient.py) and copy the code
3) Open VSC and paste it into the file we created
4) CTRL + S to save
5) Open cmd/terminal and direct to the file you saved the file to
(on windows 11 or windows shell 7 you can right click within the diretory and open a terminal from there)
6) do py "{file_name}.py" replacing "{file_name}.py" with the files name you created, for example "py "AirportClient.py""
7) Answer the prompts and have fun

   Here is and example for answers to the questions
   1) AC1089
   2) landing
   3) 18L
   4) 1
   5) IRFD
   6) Yes
